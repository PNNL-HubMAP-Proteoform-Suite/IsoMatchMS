# IsoMatchMS
A R package for matching and visualizing isotope profiles with trelliscope displays

This package includes support for: 

* Intact proteomics & proteoforms (both known PTMs and unknown mass shifts) 

* Digested proteomics 

* Lipidomics, Metabolomics, Glycomics (using molecular formula)

* Adducts of different masses 

## To install 
`devtools::install_github("PNNL-HubMAP-Proteoform-Suite/IsoMatchMS")`

To get started, read our vignette. 

## Example displays

Example trelliscope displays can be seen [here](https://pnnl-hubmap-proteoform-suite.github.io/IsoMatchMS_Trelliscope_Examples/)

If some panels do not load through github.io, try git cloning the example repo, clicking the docs folder, selecting the display you'd like to open, and then clicking the index.html file. 

Here is the command to copy the example repo: 

`git clone https://github.com/PNNL-HubMAP-Proteoform-Suite/IsoMatchMS_Trelliscope_Examples.git`
