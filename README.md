# IsoMatchMS
A R package for matching and visualizing isotope profiles with trelliscope displays

This package includes support for: 

* Intact proteomics & proteoforms (both known PTMs and unknown mass shifts) 

* Digested proteomics 

* Lipidomics, Metabolomics, Glycomics (using molecular formula)

* Adducts of different masses 

## To install 
`devtools::install_github("PNNL-HubMAP-Proteoform-Suite/IsoMatchMS")`
