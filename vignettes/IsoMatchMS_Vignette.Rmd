# What is IsoMatchMS?

IsoMatchMS was designed to match biomolecule isotope profiles to spectra, allowing for
the characterization of high-quality biomolecule annotations. Best isotope matches are
visualized in a [trelliscope](https://github.com/hafen/trelliscopejs) display,
which allows for easy sorting of isotope matches by score. 

![Alt text](./Graphical_Abstract.png "Graphical Abstract of the IsoMatchMS Package")

Much of the backend functionality is drawn from the pspecterlib package, including
generating molecular formula objects. More information about the backend package
can be found [here](https://github.com/EMSL-Computing/pspecterlib).

# Wrapper Function - run_isomatchms()

We encourage new users to run IsoMatchMS with a single wrapper function, `run_isomatchms()`.
The function requires, at a minimum, a vector containing either 
[ProForma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5837035/) strings or molecular formulas 
of the biomolecules to match, a Settings File specifying the runs parameters in 
the form of an .xlsx, and finally a pspecterlib peak_data object. 

More examples can be found below. Example datasets can be
found in the `ProteoMatch/inst/extdata` directory.

## Intact Proteins Example

The following shows an example use of the `run_isomatchms()` function containing
intact protein test data (also known as top-down proteomics). These proteins are 
"intact" and have not been digested into peptides.

Below, the .csv containing protein information is loaded in, along with the pre-made 
pspecterlib peak_data object. Further instructions on how to make this can be found 
in Section 2.3. 

Notice that in most cases, the most abundant isotope is not the monoisotopic mass 
(indicated by the blue dashed line).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Read in the protein test data
protein_data <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "Intact_Proteins_List_Short.csv", package = "IsoMatchMS"))
intact_peak_data <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "Intact_PeakData.RDS", package = "IsoMatchMS"))

# Run the IsoMatchMS wrapper function
run_isomatchms(
    Biomolecules = protein_data$Proteoform,
    BioType = "ProForma",
    SummedSpectra = intact_peak_data,
    SettingsFile = system.file("extdata", "Intact_Protein_Defaults.xlsx", package = "IsoMatchMS"),
    Path = "~/Downloads/Small_Intact_Test",
    Identifiers = protein_data$Protein.accession
)
```

## Peptides Example

The following shows an example use of the `run_isomatchms()` function with the 
peptides test data (also known as bottom-up proteomics). In other words, the
proteins have been digested into peptides. The most abundant isotope tends to
be the monoisotopic mass.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Read in the peptide test data 
peptide_data <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "Peptides_List_Short.csv", package = "IsoMatchMS"))
digested_peak_data <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "Peptides_PeakData.RDS", package = "IsoMatchMS"))

# Run the IsoMatchMS wrapper function
run_isomatchms(
    Biomolecules = peptide_data$Proteoform,
    BioType = "ProForma",
    SummedSpectra = digested_peak_data,
    SettingsFile = system.file("extdata", "Peptides_Defaults.xlsx", package = "IsoMatchMS"),
    Path = "~/Downloads/Small_Peptides_Test",
    Identifiers = peptide_data$Protein
)
```

## Glycan Example

Similar to the peptide example, the most abundant isotope tends to be the 
monoisotopic mass. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Read in the glycan test data 
glycans_data <- read.xlsx(system.file("extdata", "Glycans_List_Short.xlsx", package = "IsoMatchMS"), 1)
glycans_peak_data <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "Glycans_PeakData.RDS", package = "IsoMatchMS"))

# Run the IsoMatchMS wrapper function
run_isomatchms(
    Biomolecules = glycans_data$formula,
    BioType = "Molecular Formula",
    SummedSpectra = glycans_peak_data,
    SettingsFile = system.file("extdata", "Glycans_Defaults.xlsx", package = "IsoMatchMS"),
    Path = "~/Downloads/Small_Glycans_Test",
    Identifiers = glycans_data$name
)
```

# Accessory Functions

The IsoMatchMS package offers several stand-alone functions, including the ability
to extract ProForma strings from mzid files `pull_modifications_from_mzid()`,
converting several protein annotations to ProForma with `create_proforma()`, and
summing ms1 spectra with `sum_ms1_spectra()`. All other capabilities support the 
main IsoMatchMS function. These accessory functions were built to assist users 
in formatting their data appropriately to run the main IsoMatchMS pipeline. 

## Generating ProForma Strings

IsoMatchMS requires either molecular formulas or the ProForma string format, which
is the default format from TopPIC. However, if the data contains 
output from MSPathFinder, ProSight, or pTop instead, the `create_proforma()` function 
can be used to convert various peptide/protein/proteoform annotations to the 
ProForma Format. IsoMatchMS can also derive ProForma strings
from an .mzid file by using the `pull_modifications_from_mzid` function.

### MSPathFinder, ProSight, and pTop

The following examples show how to use the `create_proforma` function on data from 
the MSPathFinder, ProSight, and pTop. 

```{r MSPathFinder}
# MSPathFinder example with scan and protein
create_proforma(
   Sequence = c("GRGKTGGKARAKAKSRSSRAGLQFPVGRVHRL", "KKTRIIPRHLQLAIRNDEELNKLLGGVTIAY", "TEST"),
   Modifications = c("Methyl 8,Phospho 12,Phospho 22,DiMethyl 30", "TriMethyl 6,Phospho 15", ""),
   Tool = "MSPathFinder",
   Scan = c(3334, 3336, 3338),
   Protein = c("Protein33", "Protein45", "Protein47")
)
```

```{r ProSight}
# ProSight example without scan and protein
create_proforma(
   Sequence = c("(49)M(37)SGRGKQG", "SG(67)RGKQGGKARAKAKSRSSRAG", "TEST"),
   Modifications = c("N-acetyl-L-methionine (49), O-phospho-L-serine (37)", "omega-N,omega-N'-dimethyl-L-arginine (67)", ""),
   Tool = "ProSight",
   ConversionList = list("N-acetyl-L-methionine" = "Acetyl", "O-phospho-L-serine" = "Phospho", 
                         "omega-N,omega-N'-dimethyl-L-arginine" = "DiMethyl")
)
```

```{r pTop}
# pTop Example
create_proforma(
   Sequence = c("SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRKVLRDNIQGITKPAIRRL", "TEST", "PEPSRSTPAPKKGSKKAITKAQKKDGKKRKRGRKESYSIYV"),
   Modifications = c("(20)Dimethyl[K];(16)Acetyl[K];(0)Acetyl[AnyN-term];", "", "(20)Dimethyl[K];"),
   Tool = "pTop"
)
```

### .mzid file

Here, we download an example .mzid file, then use the `pull_modifications_from_mzid` 
function to create a dataframe of scan numbers, proforma strings, and protein names.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a temporary directory 
tmpdir <- tempdir()

# Copy example data to temporary directory
file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EMSL-Computing/pspecter/master/pspecter_container/TestFiles/BottomUp/BottomUp.mzid"
download.file(file, file.path(tmpdir, tail(unlist(strsplit(file, "/")), 1)))

# Pull ProForma string from an mzid file 
mod_bu <- pull_modifications_from_mzid(file.path(tmpdir, "BottomUp.mzid"))
```

## Summing MS1 Spectra

IsoMatchMS has the ability to sum the spectra contained in the .mzML file before 
running the main pipeline function with `sum_ms1_spectra()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a temporary directory and copy example data there
tmpdir <- tempdir()

# Download the test data
file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EMSL-Computing/pspecter/master/pspecter_container/TestFiles/BottomUp/BottomUp.mzML"
download.file(file, file.path(tmpdir, tail(unlist(strsplit(file, "/")), 1)))

# Summing the spectra
SummedSpec <- sum_ms1_spectra(mzMLPath = file.path(tmpdir, "BottomUp.mzML"), MinimumAbundance = 0.01)
```

# Main Pipeline Functions

## Settings File Parameters

The ProteoMatch package requires a "Settings" file in the format of on .xlsx. Some examples
of this format are provided `inst/extdata` directory. The example files show the required
parameters, suggestions for how often they will need to be changed between runs, and 
a description of the parameter. We'll take a look at the example here.

```{r}
SettingsFile <- xlsx::read.xlsx(system.file("extdata", "Intact_Protein_Defaults.xlsx", package = "IsoMatchMS"), 1)
knitr::kable(SettingsFile)
```

## Creating a Peak_Data Object

Once the optional step of summing the spectra has been completed, the pspecterlib
package can be used to create a peak_data object. This can be done with a .mzML file or 
with two vectors with MZ and Intensity values.

This is an example of reading in a summed mzML file. First, a scan_metadata object is created 
using the `pspecterlib::get_scan_metadata` function. That output is then used in the 
`pspecterlib::get_peak_data` function to create the peak_data object

```{r}
# Extract the scan metadata
scan_data <- pspecterlib::get_scan_metadata(
  MSPath = system.file("extdata", "Intact_Protein_Summed_MS1.mzML", package = "IsoMatchMS")
)

# Create the peak_data object
peak_data <- pspecterlib::get_peak_data(
  ScanMetadata = scan_data, 
  ScanNumber = 1, 
  MinAbundance = 0.1
)

head(peak_data)
```

In this example, MZ and Intensity data are read in from a .csv, and the vectors
in the data.frame are fed into `pspecterlib::make_peak_data` in order to make the peak_data object.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Reading in .csv
pd_df <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "Peptides_PeakData.csv", package = "IsoMatchMS"))

#Making the peak_data object
peak_data <- pspecterlib::make_peak_data(
  MZ = pd_df$M.Z, 
  Intensity = pd_df$Intensity
)

head(peak_data)
```

## Molecular Formulas

This step, as for the remainder of the functions outlined in the remainder of this 
vignette, are wrapped in the `run_proteomatch` function. Return to section 1 to see 
examples of running this function.

Even if molecular formulas are provided, the `calculate_molform()` 
function is required to create a IsoMatchMS_MolForm class object. Regardless of format, 
the IsoMatchMS_MolForm object will be a data.table with 9 columns: Biomolecules, 
Identifiers, Adduct Names, Adduct Masses, Charges, Molecular Formulas, Mass Shifts, Monoisotopic Masses, and
Most Abundant Isotopes. 

All of these values are calculated from a combination of the ProForma strings or molecular formulas,
charges, and adducts. If ProForma sequences are provided, they are  trimmed to 
values between the first and second period. Parenthesis are removed,  
and values within square brackets are extracted as post-translation modifications (PTMs). 
Molecular formulas, mass shifts, adducts, and charges are all tracked in this dataframe. 

Here an example is shown using peptides dataset, which contains Profroma strings.

```{r}
# Run two examples with two charge states
MolForm <- calculate_molform(
   Biomolecules = c("M.SS[Methyl]S.V", "M.S[Methyl]S[22]S[23].V"),
   BioType = "ProForma",
   Charge = 1:2
)

MolForm %>% knitr::kable()
```

To access the current modifications database, use: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load backend glossary
Glossary <- data.table::fread(
  system.file("extdata", "Unimod_v20220602.csv", package = "pspecterlib")
)

Glossary %>% 
  head() %>% 
  dplyr::select(Modification, `Mass Change`, Residues, H, C, O, N, S) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Report new modifications to be added to the pspecterlib github issues page. 

## Filter Peaks 

The `filter_peaks()` function allows users to focus their visualization on a particular 
range of M/Z values, as well as filter out noise present in their data, which will 
improve and speed up the identification process. Larger fragment data (like top-down proteomic data) 
should have a higher noise filter than small fragment data (bottom-up), since there 
are many lowly abundant peaks with high-intact data. 

The abundance values are percentages of each peak's height compared to the largest
peak. If we set a noise filter at 5, if will remove any peaks with any abundance
less than 5% of the highest intensity. As a general rule, if too many peaks are matched, 
try upping the noise filter, and if too little, try a smaller noise filter. 

## 3. Match Proteoform to MS1

Now, we pass the peak_data object (does not need to be filtered) and the molecular formula
data.table (ProteoMatch_MolForm) to the proteoform matching function. See 
`?match_biomolecule_to_ms1` for a more detailed explanation of the parameters. 

```{r}
# Run two examples with two charge states
MolForms_Test <- calculate_molform(
   Biomolecules = c("M.SS[Methyl]S.V", "M.SS[6]S[7].V"),
   BioType = "ProForma", 
   Identifiers = c("Test1", "Test2"),
   Charge = 1:2
)

# Generate some experimental peak data to match
PeakData <- pspecterlib::make_peak_data(
  MZ = c(147.5684, 148.0699, 148.5708, 149.0721, 149.5731,
         294.1296, 295.1325, 296.1343, 297.1369, 298.1390),
  Intensity = c(868.3680036, 110.9431876, 18.7179196, 1.7871629, 0.1701294,
                868.3680036, 110.9431876, 18.7179196, 1.7871629, 0.1701294)
)
# Run algorithm
Matches <- match_biomolecule_to_ms1(
   PeakData = PeakData,
   MolecularFormula = MolForms_Test,
   IsotopeMinimum = 2
)

Matches %>% knitr::kable()
```

Each match is generated with a unique ID for plotting purposes. We have
three metrics of peak match quality: Absolute Relative Error, Cosine Correlation,
and a Figure of Merit. 

The equation for Absolute Relative Error is: 

$$
\frac{1}{n}*\sum{\frac{|A_R - A_E|}{A_R}}
$$
where n is the number of peaks matched, $A_R$ is the reference abundance, and $A_E$ is the
experimental abundance. 

## Plot Results 

If there is only one match generated, the results can be easily visualized with
`plot_Ms1Match`. There are many plotting options that can be explored with `?plot_Ms1Match`

```{r}
plot_Ms1Match(
  PeakData = PeakData,
  Ms1Match = Matches, 
  ID = 1 # Pull whatever match you're interested in plotting
)
```

If there are multiple peaks, users can build a [trelliscope](https://github.com/hafen/trelliscopejs) 
display with `proteomatch_trelliscope`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
isomatchms_trelliscope(
  PeakData = PeakData,
  Ms1Match = Matches,
  Path = "~/Downloads/TrelliTest"
)
```

# Other Features 

## Adducts

In the `calculate_molform()` function, users may supply a named vector of adduct
masses to test out different adducts. For example: 

```{r}
calculate_molform(
   Biomolecules = c("C6H12O6", "C2H4O1"),
   BioType = "Molecular Formula",
   Identifiers = c("Glucose", "Acetyl"),
   AdductMasses = c(proton = 1.00727637, sodium = 22.989769),
   AddMostAbundantIsotope = TRUE
) %>% knitr::kable()
```
